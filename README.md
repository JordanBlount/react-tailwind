# React.js with Tailwind

This is an experiment building out a website using React and Tailwind. I have been wanting to test Tailwind for a few weeks now combined with my normal React workflow. 

### Thoughts
I love how Tailwind provides utility classes to quickly write out common CSS styles that we constantly use. It has helped me to shorten the time that I normally use writing (or rewriting) styles.
